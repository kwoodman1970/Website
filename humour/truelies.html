    Two old vultures were perched in a tree in Africa one day.  The first said to the other,
    "I think we should go on a vacation.  I'd like to see other parts of the world."
    The second vulture agreed, so they planned a trip to Toronto.
  </P>

  <P>
    Now, both vultures knew that the Atlantic Ocean was too wide for them to fly across
    (especially considering their advanced ages), so they each bought a ticket on an airplane.
  </P>

  <P>
    The departure day came, and the two vultures went to the airport with their tickets.  They
    were stopped, however, when they tried to board the airplane. The steward said to them, "We
    can't allow you on the plane with that carcass," referring to the remains of a wild pig
    that the vultures were taking with them.
  </P>

  <P>
    "Relax," said the first vulture.  "It's just our carrion."

    St. Peter was standing at the Pearly Gates one day, making sure that only the righteous
    were entering Heaven, when he saw four mice come up to him.  He asked the mice what their
    names were and checked his list, and (sure enough) they were righteous and could enter.
  </P>

  <P> Before they entered, though, one of the mice asked St. Peter, "How big is Heaven?"</P>

  <P>
    St. Peter said that Heaven was very big.  The mouse then expressed some concern about
    getting around because they only had small legs.  St. Peter rubbed his chin in thought for
    a moment, then he had an idea.  Within minutes, the mice were each fitted with tiny roller
    skates.
  </P>

  <P>
    A little bit later that day, a cat approached St. Peter, and it turned out to be righteous
    as well.  She rubbed herself against St. Peter's legs in gratitude for a few minutes, then
    walked in with her tail up in the air.
  </P>

  <P>
    Later that evening, when he was off duty, St. Peter went for a stroll through Heaven, and
    found the cat curled up contentedly under a tree in a park.  St. Peter asked the cat how
    she was enjoying Heaven.
  </P>

  <P>
    The cat answered, "Y'know, I lived in a very comfortable home.  I was given all the
    attention that I wanted, and I was fed whenever I wanted feeding.  That was nothing
    compared to this place!  Here, you even have meals-on-wheels!"

    Years ago, a civil engineer was hired by the City of Regina to design and build something
    that would attract tourists to the city.  "We're tired of being the butt of everyone's
    jokes," the mayor told him.  "We want you to come up with something big that will make
    Regina the centre of the world's attention."
  </P>

  <P>
    So the engineer thought for a long, long time, and hit upon an idea.  Using his talents to
    the fullest, he quickly designed a magnificent and beautiful bridge.  Shortly afterwards, a
    contractor acquired some land and built the bridge, then the city council was invited to
    admire it.  The council was horrified at what they saw.
  </P>

  <P>
    "You idiot!" screamed the mayor.  "You've built a bridge on a vacant lot!  The rivers are
    kilometres away from here!  Quick, tear it down, before anyone sees it!"
  </P>

  <P>"We can't," replied the engineer.  "There are three citizens fishing off of it."</P>

    There was a missionary who went to visit an island of cannibals in the Pacific Ocean and
    establish a mission there.  He didn't get off to a very good start though, as he was
    captured and taken prisoner by the tribe as soon as his foot touched the sand of be beach.
    He was taken to the tribe's village, where the chief came out of his hut to inspect the
    latest sacrificial offering&nbsp;&ndash; and main course.
  </P>

  <P>
    The missionary had done some research earlier and had learned to speak the tribe's
    language.  He told the chief, "I don't think that I would make a good offering, for my
    flesh is very tough.  You will not be able to eat it.  Here, carve a piece out of my leg
    and try it."  The missionary then exposed his right leg.
  </P>

  <P>
    The chief took a knife and cut out a piece of the missionary's leg.  He then placed the
    morsel in his mouth, and almost immediately spat it out in disgust.  He said, "Your flesh
    is very tough, indeed, stranger.  We cannot make an offering of you.  You are free to go."
    The missionary, however, arranged to stay and build a mission in the village, and lead a
    thriving ministry there until his retirement at a ripe, old age.
  <P>

  <P>He had a wooden leg.</P>

    A team of Canadian astronauts decided one year that they would be the first to send a
    person to the sun and bring them back again.  When asked about how they will deal with the
    intense light and heat, their spokesperson proudly declared, "We have a plan that will deal
    with those effects:  we will go at night."

    I decided to go canoeing one day, so I packed a lunch, grabbed my canoe & paddle and took
    off down the river.  I came to a shallow spot, and, as I was paddling, my paddle got stuck
    in the mud.  I didn't want to let go of it because it was the only means of control that I
    had over the canoe, so I clung fast to it&nbsp;&ndash; and my canoe shot out from
    underneath me and continue on down the river without me.  All of a sudden, the water dried
    up, and there I was&nbsp;&ndash; up the paddle without a creek.

    Quasimodo was on the verge of retiring from his job of ringing the bells at Notre Dame
    cathedral.  To ensure that there wouldn't be an interruption of service, he began
    soliciting for a replacement.  One day, there was a knock at his door.
  </P>

  <P>
    Quasimodo opened the door, and beheld a man with no arms.  Astonished, he asked the
    stranger, "How was it that you knocked on the door when you have no arms?"  The stranger
    replied, "I used my forehead.  I'm here to apply for the position of bell-ringer."
  </P>

  <P>
    Now, Quasimodo didn't really believe that the stranger could do the job, but, being a
    physically challenged person himself, decided to be politically correct and at least give
    the man a chance to prove himself.  So, they climbed to the top of one of the towers of
    Notre Dame, and, at the scheduled time, the stranger banged his forehead against the great
    bells that hung there.  He did it with such grace, precision, timing and art that Quasimodo
    was almost moved to tears.
  </P>

  <P>
    After the final note had fallen silent, Quasimodo declared that the job would be his as
    soon as he was ready for it.  The stranger was so filled with joy that he jumped up and
    down&nbsp;&ndash; and slipped, falling from the belfry to the mighty steps of the cathedral
    below.
  </P>

  <P>
    Quasimodo raced down the stairs and out the front door to where the stranger had fallen,
    but it was too late.  A small crowd began to gather, and somebody asked the hunchback who
    the stranger was.  Quasimodo replied solemnly, "I don't know his name, but his face sure
    rings a bell."

    A innkeeper at a public house in England had a fine Alsacian dog.  After many long years of
    faithful companionship, the dog died.  The innkeeper was brokenhearted, and before they
    buried the animal he took a knife and cut off the tail.  He took the tail to a taxidermist
    to be treated, then he put it on display in the pub for all to see and admire.
  </P>

  <P>
    At half-past midnight, three days after the dog had died, the innkeeper awoke to the sounds
    of a dog wailing.  It was an eerie, unnatural wail, not the sort of wail that was usually
    heard in those parts.  Trembling a bit with fear, the innkeeper got up, lit a candle and
    went downstairs to investigate.
  </P>

  <P>
    When he opened the front door of the pub, he beheld the ghostly spectre of his dog.  The
    eyes were empty save for the blue flames the flickered dimly in the shadowy sockets.  The
    phantom wailed again, then looked at the innkeeper in despair and spoke.  "For many years,
    I have been your faithful companion and friend, and you have treated me with love and
    respect.  But now, I cannot rest for I am incomplete.  Please, return my tail to my body so
    that I may rest in peace."
  </P>

  <P> "Sorry," the innkeeper replied tersely, "we don't retail spirits here past midnight."</P>
