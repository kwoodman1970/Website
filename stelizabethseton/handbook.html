    <H3>A. Boundaries &amp; Registration</H3>

    <P>
      St. Elizabeth Seton School is a Kindergarten to Grade 9 school, operating
      under the auspices of the Calgary Roman Catholic School District.  Our
      school serves Catholic students living in the communities of Hidden
      Valley, Hanson Ranch and Panorama Hills.
    </P>
  </DIV>

  <DIV ID="OurPatronSaint" CLASS="Item">
    <H3>B. Our Patron Saint</H3>

    <P>
      The school is named in honour of St. Elizabeth Seton. St Elizabeth Seton
      was the first American born saint (born in New York City). St. Elizabeth
      was married at age nineteen and became the mother to five children.
      After the death of her husband, she became a Roman Catholic and began to
      serve the poor in the Baltimore area, especially in the field of
      education.  A well educated woman, she trained teachers, wrote textbooks
      and translated spiritual writings from French.  She founded the Sisters
      of Charity and is considered a founder of Catholic parochial school
      education in the United States.

  <DIV ID="Attendence" CLASS="Item">
    <H3>D. Attendance</H3>

    <P>
      The School Act states that students must be punctual and attend school
      regularly.  In the event of any absence, parents are requested to contact
      the school to indicate the reason.  This may be done by phoning the
      school at 374-0406.  In the case of a medical or dental appointment, a
      note should be sent in advance.
    </P>

    <P>
      When students are absent without such prior notice, the office will
      attempt to contact a parent by telephone to confirm the absence.  This
      phone contact is necessary to ensure the safety of students and to
      maintain a proper record of absences.
    </P>

    <P>
      Prolonged absence or irregular attendance results in a lack of program
      continuity and is detrimental to learning.  As a result, students who are
      repeatedly late or absent without a reasonable excuse are considered to
      be in violation of the School Act.  <B>After five unexcused absences, the
      student may be referred to the school district social worker.</B>
    </P>
  </DIV>

  <DIV ID="EntranceExitDoor" CLASS="Item">
    <H3>E. Entrance/Exit Door</H3>

    <P>
      We ask that students <B>NOT</B> use the main entrance unless they are
      late and are reporting their arrival to the secretary or are
      <SPAN CLASS="Underline">accompanied</SPAN> by a parent.  Students must
      otherwise use their assigned door and arrange to meet siblings or friends
      on the tarmac at the back of our school.
    </P>
  </DIV>

  <DIV ID="SchoolParkingLot" CLASS="Item">
    <H3>F. School Parking Lot</H3>

    <P>
      In the interest of safety, the school parking lot is <B>OUT OF BOUNDS</B>
       at all times.  Students must use the sidewalks on the perimeter of the
       parking lot when moving to the bus stop.  Parents dropping off or
       picking up students must do so in the designated zones directly in front
       of the school.  Your close attention to the signs will help to ensure
       that you are not ticketed and that your children are safe.

      volunteers <B>are required to enter by the front doors and register at

    <H3>H. Lunch Program</H3>

    <P>
      A supervised lunch period is provided for students.  A supervision fee is
      charged in order to provide adequate supervision.  A canteen which sells
      nutritional items is available on a daily basis.  Students may leave the
      gym <B>when they are dismissed by a supervisor</B> to go outdoors.  All
      students must vacate the gym by <B>11:55&nbsp;pm</B> to allow for clean
      up.  Students, who remain at school for lunch, are encouraged to
      participate in the activities offered.  Individuals not involved in some
      organised activity are expected to go outside.  Elementary students
      <B>must</B> stay on school grounds when they eat lunch at school.  It is
      hoped that Jr. High students will remain on school grounds also.  <B>The
      school cannot assume responsibility for those students who choose to
      leave school grounds during the lunch hour.  Furthermore, when junior
      high students leave the grounds, it is assumed that the parents are aware
      and have given their child permission to do so.</B> Failure of students
      to respect the noon hour expectations may result in this privilege being
      withdrawn for a specified period of time.

    <P>
      Among the values taught in our Catholic Schools are the virtues of
      decency, modesty and respect.  Our goal is to provide a positive and safe
      learning environment that will reflect a Catholic Community of Caring.
      It is therefore in the best interest of our school community to have a
      dress code that will help students to make appropriate choices regarding
      dress.
    </P>

    <P>
      Students must wear clothing that is appropriate for educational
      activities and that will not cause a disruption to the educational

        Clothing that reveals bare backs, bare shoulders (including spaghetti
        straps, bare midriffs and/or plunging necklines, tank tops, muscle
        shirts and fish nets) is prohibited.

      including Physical Education and recess.

      Students are expected to demonstrate behaviours which reflect the values
      of Catholic Education and are necessary for the maintenance of an
      effective learning-teaching environment.  Any school-sponsored activity
      demands that students exhibit both respect and responsibility.  These
      activities are over and above the regular school program and, as such,
      are privileges &ndash; not rights.  Participation in these activities may
      be withheld due to breaches of the school's behaviour code.

    <P>Specifically, a student is expected to:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>
        Show <SPAN CLASS="Underline">respect</SPAN> for the rights and dignity
        of others.  Harassment, either verbal or physical is considered a

        insolent comments or racial taunts are not acceptable.
      </LI>
      <LI>

        his/her own and that of others including the school building, equipment

        of these expectations.
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Show <SPAN CLASS="Underline">respect</SPAN> for him/herself.  A
        student is expected to be prepared for class and to work consistently
        to the level of his/her ability. The use of tobacco, drugs or alcohol
        on school property or during school hours is also considered to be a
