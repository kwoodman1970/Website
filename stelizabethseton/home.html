<H2>
  Welcome to St. Elizabeth Seton School!
</H2>

<P>
  Our teachers and staff look forward to working with you throughout the school
  year.  Plans have been made to help us build a school that has a strong
  instructional focus and a caring, Catholic school culture.  We are blessed
  with an exceptional staff, talented students and supportive parents.
</P>

<P>
  Catholic schools are here to support parents' values, and beliefs and to
  allow children to live out those values in an environment based on gospel
  values and the spiritual journey of which we are all a part.  We ask your
  assistance, cooperation and support so that together, with
  <A HREF="http://www.stjohnsparish.ca/">St. John the Evangelist Parish</A>, we
  may meet the mandate of educating your children in the
  Catholic academic tradition.  With the guidance of the Holy Spirit, trust and
  mutual support we can meet any challenges and continue to develop a tradition
  of caring and excellence at St. Elizabeth Seton School.
</P>

<P>
  <A HREF="handbook.html">This handbook</A> is designed to familiarise you with
  our school.  In addition, <A HREF="http://www.sessc.eboard.com">eboard</A>,
  verbal and written communiqués will attempt to keep you currently informed.
  We then invite you to contact your child's homeroom and subject teachers
  first, then any of the school administrators for further assistance regarding
  your child's progress or information about the school.  Please read
  <A HREF="handbook.html">this booklet</A> and use it as a guide for future
  reference.
</P>

<P>
  Sincerely,
</P>
