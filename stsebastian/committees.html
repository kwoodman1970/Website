      <HR>

      <H3>Playground Committee</H3>

      <P>
        Playgrounds form the heart of a school and its growing community.  This
        committee generally becomes the primary focus of the school and its
        school council.  Fundraising methods, grant applications and
        organization of an army of volunteers become the buzzwords for this
        committee
      </P>

      <H3>Logo and Banner Development Committee</H3>

      <P>
        A logo is a symbol of the chool and its patron saint that immediately
        identifies it to the public at large as a Catholic school.  This logo
        is shown on all school letterhead, illustrated on newslatters,
        represented on School Distric correspondence and is naturally featured
        as a centrepiece of the school's gymnasium.
      </P>

      <P>
        All schools in the
        <A HREF="http://www.cssd.ab.ca/">Calgary Catholic School District</A>
        are represented by a school banner that depicts its core values and
        mission statement.  It is positioned in the school's main foyer
        showing what we are all about.  Once we have a starting point with
        both a logo and banner, a graphic representation will be developed and
        then those symbols will be formalized.
      </P>

      <H3>School Council</H3>

      <P>
        Normally, school councils are elected in May of the prior year of its
        operations.  School Council plays a critical role in the operations of
        the school.  The executive and members of council provide an important
        advisory role.  School administration looks to the council for their
        valuable support and input.
       </P>

       <P>
         Typically, there are four executive positions:
       </P>

       <UL>
         <LI>Chair</LI>
         <LI>Vice Chair</LI>
         <LI>Secretary</LI>
         <LI>Treasurer</LI>
       </UL>

       <P>
         Parents are encouraged to consider whether they have something to
         offer in these roles.  Naturally, the development of a constitution
         and by-laws becomes a primary focus in the first year of operation.
       </P>
