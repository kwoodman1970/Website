        <LI>
          <B>If I live outside of Chaparral can my children attend St.
          Sebastian Elementary School?</B>

          <P>
            Not at this time.  Only Catholic students residing in the community
            of Chaparral can attend St. Sebastian Elementary School.
          </P>
         </LI>
         <LI>
           <B>What are the bell times for the school?</B>

           <P>
             Bell times for the instructional day have not yet been determined.
             Bell times are linked directly to bus schedules and these are
             still being developed across our school district.  The number of
             students riding the bus and the availability of qualified bus
             drivers are important factors determining bus routes.  It is
             expected that bus routes will be determined in this spring, and
             with that information bell times will be developed.
             Please refer to this or the
             <A HREF="http://www.cssd.ab.ca/">District's</A> web site for
             current information.

           <B>Will St. Sebastian Elementary School open in September?</B>

           <P>
             St. Sebastian Elementary School is on pace to open in September
             2007.  Parents will be notified if any changes in construction
             patterns occur, which could disrupt the construction schedule.
           </P>

         <LI>
           <B>Our house is under construction in Chaparral.  Can my child
           attend St. Sebastian starting in September, 2007?</B>

           <P>
             Yes.  If you will be assuming possession of your home during the
             2007&nbsp;- 2008 school year, then your child can attend St.
             Sebastian Elementary School starting in September.  Please be
             aware, however, that you would be responsible for transporting
             your child from your current location.

           <B>Will my child be eligible for bus transportation to and from
           school?</B>

           <P>
             Bus transportation is provided to Chaparral students who live
             within 1.25 kilometers from St. Sebastian Elementary School.
             Along with bus route information, the designated eligibility area
             for bus transportation will also be provided this spring.  Maps
             will be drawn up and provided to parents so that eligibility is
             clear.  Please be reminded that transportation fees are:
             $165/student or $330/family.
