      <P>
        Sebastian was born at Narbonne, in Gaul, and was raised by his parents
        in Milan, Italy.  It is reported that he possessed great physical
        endurance and had a natural inclination to military life.  He became a
        soldier in the Roman army at Rome in about the year 283.  Emperor
        Diocletian later named Sebastian captain in the Praetorian guards,
        unaware that he was a Christian.  Sebastian was actually a faithful
        follower of Christ and, by 286, was using his position in the
        Praetorian Guard to assist Christian confessors and martyrs in their
        suffering.  At the time that the Roman army was ruthlessly
        participating in the persecution of Christians, he was secretly
        committing many acts of love and charity for those being persecuted.
      </P>

      <P>
        Sebastian is known to have encouraged two Roman martyrs &ndash;
        Marcellian and Marcus (both under the sentence of death) &ndash;
        to remain faithful to Christ.  During this time he is also known to
        have converted many Romans to Christianity and cured others of sickness
        through his strength in faith.
      </P>

      <P>
        Once it was discovered by Emperor Diocletian that Sebastian was a
        Christian, he was sentenced to death by being shot full of arrows by
        the Mauritanian archers.  Being left for dead, Sebastian was found and
        miraculously nursed back to health.  A short time later, however,
        Sebastian openly criticized the Emperor for his persecution of
        Christians and was executed by being beaten to death.  He is reported
        to have died on January 20, 287.
      </P>

      <P>
        Sebastian was one of a class of military martyrs and soldier saints of
        the Early Christian Church.  He is a patron saint of athletes because
        of his physical endurance and energetic way of spreading and defending
        the faith.  He is also a patron to all soldiers.  The feast day for St.
        Sebastian is January 20.
